### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I never really understood the game of Blackjack, so it was a challenge to write this program. I learned how to write a program that can compute the score for a hand of blackjack with exactly two cards. I also learned how to better approach a situation where I need to write several functions.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was also one of my favorite labs because it was simple and fun to complete. Since this was the only lab done individually rather than in pairs, it was fun to play around and learn on our own. Also, I learned how to use and implement arithmetic operators in my program.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it involved calculating the unit price of one of my favorite foods: pizza. Through this lab, I learned how to calculate the unit price of pizza using the diameter and price. I also learned how to use doubles in my program.
